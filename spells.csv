You and up to three creatures of your choice can enter the portal and pass through it, arriving at the target destination (or within 10 feet of it, if it is currently occupied). If the target destination doesn’t exist or is inaccessible, the spell automatically fails and the gate doesn’t form.

Any creature that tries to move through the gate, other than those selected by you when the spell was cast, takes 10d6 acid damage and is teleported 1d100 × 10 feet in a random, horizontal direction.

Adjust Position,1st-level,transmutation,"You adjust the location of an ally to a better tactical position. You move one willing creature within range 5 feet.

The first trapdoor appears where you touch the surface, and the other appears at a point you can see up to 30 feet away. The two trapdoors can be wooden with a metal ring handle, or they can match the surrounding surfaces, each with a small notch for opening the door. The two trapdoors are connected by an extradimensional passage that is up to 5 feet wide, up to 5 feet tall, and up to 30 feet long. The trapdoors don't need to be on the same surface, allowing the passage to connect two separated locations, such as the two sides of a chasm or river. The passage is always straight and level for creatures inside it, and the creatures exit the tunnel in such a way that allows them to maintain the same orientation as when they entered the passage. No more than five creatures can transit the passage at the same time.

Until the spell ends, you can ask the ancient spirit up to five questions if it died within the past year, four questions if it died within ten years, three within one hundred years, two within one thousand years, and but a single question for spirits more than one thousand years dead. The ancient shade knows only what it knew in life, including languages. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn’t return the creature’s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can’t learn new information, doesn’t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can’t speculate about future events.","Cleric, Wizard"
Angel Paradox,7th-level,Evocation,"The target is bombarded with a fraction of energy stolen from some slumbering, deific source, immediately taking 40 radiant damage. This spell ignores resistances but does not ignore immunities. A creature killed by this spell does not decay and cannot become undead for the spell's duration.

Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the DM has the creature's game statistics). 

On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor.

An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size. Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form. If you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The DM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.","Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard"
